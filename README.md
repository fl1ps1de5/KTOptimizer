This repo contains the code and data pertaining to a ShinyApp.

This was created to be an app used by doctors to optimize the process of kidney transplants, and overcome the disparity between transplant patients and donors. The app allows the doctor to input a patient's gene expression data, and see their long term post-transplant survival. Based on the metrics in the app, the doctor will be able to make an informed decision of which patient should recieve the transplant kidney, in order to give them the maximum "years" to live.

Sample patient data is provided in the repo.
